## Phylogeny Project

The goal of the phylogeny project is to track the evolution of a genetic sequence with time. For example the genome of Sars-Cov2 varied as it traveled from Wuhan to California. In
particular, it "mutated" in a few positions. Here mutation refers to a base being inserted, deleted or substituted. Phylogeny is crucial to understanding the inter-relationship between different species and tracking evolutionary progress.
